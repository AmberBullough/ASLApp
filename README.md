Hello! My name is Amber Bullough.
I am the Sterling Scholar Nominee for 2018 in Computer Technology from Alta High School. 

This is the README file for my project, an American Sign Language App that is kid friendly and for new learners.

Currently, I have finished my project to Version 1.0, which includes six topics:

Animals
The Alphabet
Numbers
Colors
Phrases
People

The Animals include the topic of Pets, with cartoon-like animal drawings for children to see. 
The Alphabet includes all 26 letters to use for fingerspelling.
The Numbers are the numbers of 0-50, written out and in their numeric form.
The Colors not only include colors, but also a button that changes the color of the background for entertainment. 
The Phrases are every day common phrases such as greetings.
The People are of family.

I plan on expanding it to version 2.0 and include more Animals, Numbers, Phrases, and People, as well as Food.
I put a lot of my time into this project and I am proud of the results so far.

Please take a look at my code and other projects here on my GitHub.
